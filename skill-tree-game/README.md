- **🎓 Progressive Skill Tree**: 3-tier system from foundations to specializations
- **📸 Screenshot Evidence**: Firebase Storage integration for image uploads
- **🧙‍♂️ AI Advisor**: Contextual guidance and recommendations
- **📊 Real-time Progress**: XP tracking, leveling, and achievement system
- **🔗 Clear Prerequisites**: Visual arrows showing skill dependencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Firebase account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tnystrand1/futurecoding.git
   cd futurecoding/skill-tree-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your Firebase project credentials
   # Get these from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Web App
   ```

4. **Initialize Firestore database**
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**

   - Original UI: `http://localhost:5173/student/sample_student`

## 🔐 Security Configuration

**⚠️ Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control!

### Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
